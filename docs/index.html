Nasmaste dear reader

<p> 
Here is some information to setup secure communication for tt20.

This is a wip, progres will be likely stated here.

<p>
Currently I am thinging building a secured structure to communicate
via strong encryption and multifactor authentication
to create a trusted environment.

<p>

For questions and ideas <a href="mailto:tt20@xs4all.nl">mail me</a> .
